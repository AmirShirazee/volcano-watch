## Introduction

Volcanic eruptions are unpredictable natural disasters that can cause significant loss of life and property. This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for monitoring volcanic activity, predicting potential eruptions using machine learning models, and sending out alerts to minimize risks. The system is designed for use by governmental bodies, research institutions, and anyone interested in volcanic monitoring.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Collects data from various sensors and satellites to monitor volcanic activity in real-time.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of an eruption based on historical and real-time data.
- **Alert System**: Sends alerts via SMS, email, or other channels when a potential eruption is detected.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides a dashboard to visualize volcanic activity, historical data, and prediction outcomes.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Can be deployed on cloud platforms to handle large-scale data processing and analysis.

## Installation

To get started with the Volcanic Activity Monitoring System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmirShirazee/volcano-watch.git
   cd volcano-watch
   ```
